Hi, comrades! Me again helping with your assignment so that you don't have to pay people to do your assignments OR spend unwanted time to it!

**Notes:**
- `student.txt` has 3 test cases provided, 2 are normal extra test cases, and 1 is without ID.

# Tips for Presentations

1. **Just run your code and show it:** Lecturers don't give a care about your code; all they care about is "Is this code running well?" (by just demonstrating it).

2. **Emphasize test cases:**REMEMBER to include your test files during compilation to showcase your code's reliability.

3. **Avoid explaining code line by line:** Rather than going through each line, focus on explaining your code's overall structure and key elements.
