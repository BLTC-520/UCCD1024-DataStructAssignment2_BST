# UCCD1024-DataStructuresAssignment2_BST

Hi, comrades! Me again helping with your assignment so that you don't have to pay people to do your assignments OR spend unwanted time to do it!

**Notes:**
- `student.txt` has 3 test cases provided, 2 are normal extra test cases, and 1 is without ID.

## **What is this assignment for?**

This assignment demonstrates the use of **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** to manage and manipulate student records efficiently. It allows users to:

- Load student data from a text file into a BST.

- Display the _deepest nodes_ in the tree.

- _Display student records_ in ascending or descending order, either on screen or to a file.

- _Clone a subtree_ based on a specific student ID and display both the original and cloned trees.

- _Print nodes_ level by level and display paths in the BST.

The program applies key BST operations such as **insertion, searching, cloning subtrees, and various tree traversals**, providing a practical application of tree data structures in student information systems.

### **Tips for Presentations**

1. **Just run your code and show it.**

2. **Emphasize test cases:** REMEMBER to include your test files during compilation to showcase your code's reliability.

3. **Avoid explaining code line by line:** Rather than going through each line, focus on explaining your code's overall structure and key elements.
